# Mechatrons_Robotics_CLUB-CU                                                          **Re-Started 21-08-2021**

An official Club that aims to create a competitive environment among students of Department of Mechatronics, at Chandigarh University

## About
- An interdisciplinary club, with associated faculty members from Aeronautical, Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering and Mechanical Engineering Departments. 
- The club plans to get actively involved in carrying out research in various areas of Robotics ranging from Kinematics, Dynamics and Design, Motion Planning, Intelligent Control, AI, Computer Vision, etc.

## Mission
- To work on projects like autonomous bots, humanoids, swarm of tiny robots, robotic arms or aerial vehicles, etc.
- The club also aims to provide much more than just technical growth to its members, from team-building to cooperation, from perseverance to sincerity, hence teaching you a myriad of interpersonal skills essential in daily life. 
- The club is open to students with or without experience because, believe it or not, none of us had any idea of robotics when we first stepped into the club room, neither do we expect anything from you. 
- You just need to show up and the club and its people will take care of the rest. 
- The club's environment aims to perpetuate the sharing of wisdom and experience amongst our members. 
- We cater to every individual who ever wanted to design their own circuit and control their own bot. 
**All we need from you is enthusiasm!**
